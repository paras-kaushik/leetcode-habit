## The Laws of Habit Building
James Clear identifies several fundamental laws for building and maintaining habits:

1. **Make it Obvious**: This extension provides a clear cue by displaying the "Problem of the Day" on your new tab, making your daily habit-building obvious and easy to start.

4. **Make it Satisfying**: As you complete tasks within the daily scheduler, you'll find a sense of satisfaction and reward, reinforcing your habit-building.

- **Enhanced Productivity**: Timeboxing encourages focus and prevents procrastination, leading to increased productivity.

- **Improved Time Management**: It helps you prioritize tasks and allocate time efficiently, ensuring that important activities are not neglected.
